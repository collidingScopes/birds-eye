Turn with left/right instead of A/D
Only allow forward movement (press a button or always moving forward)
teleport to other cities
only render building / ground data that is very close
Spin up some other tokens 
Check usage limits
Make forward moevment faster (allow walk or sprint or fly speeds)

Add minimap / street names / key landmarks / other actual world data

Speed boost, jetpack, bird mode, plane mode, car mode, coins, etc.....

different style palettes for buildings / shader options (cyberpunk, realistic, day, sun, rain, snow, etc..)

Spiderman mode (swing on buildings by clicking them)

Use character animation instead

Frustum culling / LOD / other performance enhancements

Collision detection so that the player can land on top of buildings

Make "levels" in different cities where the player has to land on a building or get to a certain location as fast as possible (or collect secret items)

multiplayer

players can leave markers / notes for their favourite locations (saved to local storage) -- pictures, spotlights, minimap markers -- as if they are pinning on google maps

More locations (enter gps coordinates or use current user location)

Can we do some caching in local storage to reduce bing maps sessions / data streaming from cesium
