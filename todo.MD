Spin up some other cesium tokens 

Speed boost, jetpack, bird mode, plane mode, car mode, coins, etc.....

different style palettes for buildings / shader options (cyberpunk, realistic, day-night mode, sun, rain, snow, etc..)

Change the city aesthetic based on real weather conditions / time of day

Spiderman mode (swing on buildings by clicking them)

Player is rotating in 3D when arrow keys are used -- not right

Different sky options (gradient, sunset, night, etc...)

Make "levels" in different cities where the player has to land on a building or get to a certain location as fast as possible (or collect secret items)

multiplayer

players can leave markers / notes for their favourite locations (saved to local storage) -- pictures, spotlights, minimap markers -- as if they are pinning on google maps

Can we do some caching in local storage to reduce bing maps sessions / data streaming from cesium

Deploy on vercel or netlify so that I can keep the token private
