Spin up some other cesium tokens 

Make forward moevment faster (allow walk or sprint or fly speeds)

Speed boost, jetpack, bird mode, plane mode, car mode, coins, etc.....

Minimap:
- update more frequently?
- keep the player positioned in the center
- direction is incorrect, just show as a dot instead?
- need to add a "show" button after hiding it
- only show max of 4 roads?
- show neighborhood name in different font color

different style palettes for buildings / shader options (cyberpunk, realistic, day-night mode, sun, rain, snow, etc..)

Change the city aesthetic based on real weather conditions / time of day

Spiderman mode (swing on buildings by clicking them)

Use character animation instead

Collision detection so that the player can land on top of buildings

Make "levels" in different cities where the player has to land on a building or get to a certain location as fast as possible (or collect secret items)

multiplayer

players can leave markers / notes for their favourite locations (saved to local storage) -- pictures, spotlights, minimap markers -- as if they are pinning on google maps

More locations (enter gps coordinates or use current user location)

Can we do some caching in local storage to reduce bing maps sessions / data streaming from cesium

Deploy on vercel or netlify so that I can keep the token private

Ground shouldn't shift when player moves. Also, ground not synced to the correct elevation of the bottom of the buildings
