Spin up some other cesium tokens 

forward movement speed should increase as you hold W more (ramp up)

Speed boost, jetpack, bird mode, plane mode, car mode, coins, etc.....

Minimap:
- update more frequently?
- show neighborhood name in different font color

different style palettes for buildings / shader options (cyberpunk, realistic, day-night mode, sun, rain, snow, etc..)

Change the city aesthetic based on real weather conditions / time of day

Spiderman mode (swing on buildings by clicking them)

Player is rotating in 3D when arrow keys are used -- not right

Sky / ground textures

Style nearby buildings with shaders??

Ground not synced to the correct elevation of the bottom of the buildings

Make "levels" in different cities where the player has to land on a building or get to a certain location as fast as possible (or collect secret items)

multiplayer

players can leave markers / notes for their favourite locations (saved to local storage) -- pictures, spotlights, minimap markers -- as if they are pinning on google maps

More locations (enter gps coordinates or use current user location)

Can we do some caching in local storage to reduce bing maps sessions / data streaming from cesium

Deploy on vercel or netlify so that I can keep the token private

Add trees and other natural features in threejs

mobile support -- nipple.js

Refactor and improve code for fps

Only re-check buildling collision if moving more than x meters
